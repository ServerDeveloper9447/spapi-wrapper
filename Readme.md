### If you're in our support server then you probably know that the api recently experienced a ddos attack. Thats why we changed the URL and now making a v2 of the API. Versions before 1.1.1 will no longer work
**Upcoming changes**
```ini
[V2 Of The API is in making. Set to release on 15th November or before. To Stay Updated join Our Support Server On Discord.]
[If you use the wrapper then no worries. Just always use the updated version of the wrapper. When V2 releases, some endpoints will be shifted to V2. All image endpoints will be shifted and upcoming image endpoints will be added in V2.]

[Note: V2 wrapper will be released in a seperate package.]
```

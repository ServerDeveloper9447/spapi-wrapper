## Changes in v2.0.1
```diff
+ Added custom subreddit finding in meme endpoint
```
### If you're in our support server then you probably know that the api recently experienced a ddos attack. ~~Thats why we changed the URL and now making a v2 of the API. Versions before 1.1.1 will no longer work~~<br> Old Versions will work again. Now both api.spapi.ga and apiv1.spapi.ga works same.
